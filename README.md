# uws
Universal Web Server for development purposes. It is similar to `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or
`php -S 127.0.0.0:8080` commands but requires less typing and tries to detect the stack to serve it accordingly.

# Installation

If you have Go toolchain installed, you can use the following command to install `uws`:
```
go install github.com/sibprogrammer/uws
```
